## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: TradePulse
- **Category**: defi

### Description
TradePulse is a lightweight on-chain trade verification tool that uses Soundness Layer to validate off-chain computations (example: trade settlement proofs), increasing trust between counterparties.

### SL Integration
Soundness Layer verifies off-chain computations via zk-proofs; result blob IDs stored on-chain for auditability.

## Technical
### Architecture
Frontend → Backend → SL verifier → on-chain proof record. Metadata on IPFS.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + Ethereum testnet
- **Storage**: IPFS

### Features
1. Submit trade result proofs
2. Verify and record proof IDs on-chain
3. Simple dashboard for trades & status

## Timeline
PoC (2-4 weeks): basic verification flow + SL integration  
MVP (4-8 weeks): UI, security checks, user testing
